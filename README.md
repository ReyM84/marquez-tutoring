#Getting Started

Tutors will be able to sign up with their own Google Accounts. They will be able to add a student contact form. 

Further down the road they will also be able to submit an available form on a weekly basis and check when they are scheduled for that week.

I also plan to have a separate login for parents so that they can keep track of their student's progress. There will also be a way for them to upload important papers for their students.
